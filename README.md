# VoogaSalad
A powerfully flexible game authoring environment.

###Overview
VoogaSalad is a game authoring environment, written in Java using the JavaFX framework, that I developed along with 9 other team members. The software stack also included third-party libraries such as XStream, Xuggler, and the REST API from Clarifai.

The program is a comprehensive and extensive tool for game development of many genres, including side-scrolling platformers, top-down shooters, tower defense, and arcade. 

###Responsibilities
During the project, I worked extensively on front-end development and integration of the authoring environment with the engine. Notable features I developed include a graphical topology visualization for the web of level networks, advanced game lookup using machine learning and search algorithms, and interpolation of user-defined paths to simulate smooth translational animation.
